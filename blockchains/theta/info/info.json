    "description": "THETA (THETA) is an open source protocol that powers a decentralized streaming network. It will allow for decentralized apps (DApps) to be built on top of the platform to enable use cases that span esports, entertainment, and peer-to-peer streaming. SLIVER.tvâ€™s DApp was the first application built on the Theta network leveraging its existing user base of millions of esports viewers. In Nov 2018, Tencent Games announced a collaboration with SLIVER.tv to bring Theta rewards to Ring of Elysium players. The founding team has a combined 30+ years of experience in the video streaming space with advisors including Steve Chen, Co-Founder of YouTube, and Justin Kan, Co-Founder of Twitch.",
